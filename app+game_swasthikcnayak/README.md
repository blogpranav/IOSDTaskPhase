## Getting Started

This is the first flutter application that I have written by using the code available in the documentation and some google.
I got to learn pretty much about flutter as well as dart. 
Programming was not a major concern.

some problems that I encountered while creating the application:


-->Linking multiple pages


-->avoiding the back button from login page


-->Aligning the login credentials and details


somehow figured out all the aspects and everything is working fine now


However it was a good experience.
