![DEMO OF THE APP](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DimpledCoolHammerheadshark-size_restricted.gif)


The App is to Demonstrate a Login Screen Application.
I used a simple UI to build the stroyboard and splash screen.
The TextField Entries trigger the Avatar Image to Change.
I faced  a bit of problem while running the app on Physical device and later after a research I came to a conclusion that its because of the bug in latest Xcode 11.3.1 has .
The app i made worked on all iPhone Simulators and ipad Simulators fine, in all the orientations except for the upside down because i never added it.
The Other problem i had is where the text fields get truncated, I figured it out quickly enough that i didnt make much trouble
In the Demo, The Storyboard scrolls up as the keyboard is opened in order to avoid the blocking the view of textfields.
[command + k ]triggers the keyboard and closes it.
I didnt make UI for second screen because, Hard coded data is being used, I added up a profile photo as you asked on the top, and rest i used simple labels.
You can clone the app using source control of Xcode.
Thats it The App is Done!!
