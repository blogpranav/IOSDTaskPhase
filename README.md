# IOSD Competitive Programming Solutions(TASKPHASE)

The main source i used to write my programs were some refrences from geeksforgeeks website.
I wrote the code in the C++ language.
I have been learning about some competitive programming techniques and hence the problems 
were solved without much difficulty.

I have used thes statements to remove C input and output methods so that the program is much faster and cin.tie is used
to clear stdout before taking input.
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
In the program of odd even set(3rd question) there was problem in solving the part od duplication for which i created another array which keeps track of the element already there.
for counting 1's in the binary form of the number i used bit manipulation using bitwise operators

In the question nobita likes momos i used selection sort instead of using the standard library function, rest was not that difficult.
