                                     Web Dev Task Report
                                    ABOUT THE WEBSITE
The website that I created is based on a fictional startup named "HERCULES FITNESS".
I have enclosed the website in my branch which encourages you to exercise regularly and 
How HERCULES FITNESS can help you in achieving the perfect you. This website is actually 
the membership form of the Fitness centre that accepts input from the user like his name,
gender,address and email (in webpage 1) .The user should submit his info (in webpage1)
and then continue with the membership process (in webpage2). The second webpage
displays the Membership fees for different duration of Memembership.It accepts input 
regarding the duration of membership and payment of membership fee.The user can select
one of the options given and can submit his/her details to the server( here my email address).

                                     PROBLEMS FACED
i) I was unable to make the submit button perform two tasks at a time i.e. submitting the information 
    to my mail address as well as transit me to the next webpage.
ii) Also the link that I established between the webpages using anchor tag in "Continue with
     Membership Process" works fine in my pc (I was able to transit to the linked webpage)
    but failed to do the same in my friend's pc (It said File Not Found).
iii) Initially I thought of placing a pic of membership card designed by me so it was saved in 
     my pc and I was able to see it on the webpage but that thing will not work with others.
    So how can we make it possible??

                                       SOURCES USED
i) Help from my friend (He is in IEEE and has done web dev task in winter breaks).
ii) www.w3schools.com help me alot regarding placing videos and autoplay etc
    I got all my doubts cleared from this site.
